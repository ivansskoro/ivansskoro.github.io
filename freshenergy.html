					<h3>The challenge</h3>
					<p>
					Taking over an existing project and reworking the UX and UI without alienating existing users — while adding features aligned with
					 business goals.
					Also, product had to be designed in a way that allowed whitelabeling, since that was part of the business model.
					I was requested to come up with a new brand solution as well.
				 	</p>
				</section>
				<h3>My process</h3>
				<p>
				Initial interviews with all stakeholders aligned me on business and product goals. To identify user goals and
				define a feature roadmap, we surveyed our users via Facebook groups and email — and invited dozens for in-house interviews.
				I facilitated design sprints to bring new features to life.
				A deep dive into finding company values through multiple sessions with the management set the tables
				for a complete brand redesign.

				<h2>
					I started by decreasing the Customer Aquisition Cost and redesigning the information architecture of
					all apps — having in mind the whitelabeling requirements — while ideating features aligned with business requirements.
					Following a rebrand, a new visual style was applied.

				CAC was reduced by -20% and 4 new whitelabel partners signed up. 3/10 most requested features (by public vote)
				were rolled out.

				<h3>Information Architecture</h3>
				<p>
					Tab bar navigation replaced the old side-menu navigation. Based on user interviews,
					new sections such as profile and household information
					were added to their expected places.
					To support future business goals, a services section was added as well.
				</p>
				</br>
				<p>
					Main use cases — checking live and historic electricity consumption — were simplified and enriched with new ways of displaying data

				<h3>Reducing cost to serve</h3>
				<p>
					To reduce cost to serve, edit functionality was added for personal information.
					Weekly average was 6 support calls per 1000 users.

				<h3>Meeting business and user goals</h3>
				<p>
					By leveraging the data we had and working with product and business teams, I was able to define innovative services.
					By basing them on existing data, we saved precious development time and reduced time to market.
				</p>
				<p>
					Before building a service, we wanted to assess its viability with a simple pilot project.
					Pilot projects were done through email communication and manual work. After confirming the demand,
					we went ahead with the actual implementation in the product.
					Design was tested during and after the UI/UX phase.

				<h3>Refresh — service 1</h3>
				<p>
					“Refresh” works with existing data. With insight into our users dishwasher usage we can send
					them dishwasher tabs just before they run out.

				<h3>Fridge recommendation — service 2</h3>
				<p>
					Users fridge consumption is compared to our database. Based on that we show our users potential savings —
					together with the amortization time.

						A short 3 day design sprint was used to define and quickly prototype this feature. We found  that———

					The web version of was designed with the same basic functionality —

				<h3>Design system compatible with whitelabeling</h3>

					The UI was designed to allow partners to adapt it to their branding. Colors and font sizes are used sparringly.

				<h3>Rebrand</h3>

					A new logo was brought to life together with company wide goals and values.
					It plays of the combination of letters F and E — representing transformer coils — transforming our users experience with electricity.
