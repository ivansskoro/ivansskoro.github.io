				<h2>Empowering senior members of our society.</h2>
				<p>
				Fresh Care analyzes seniors' electricity usage via an intelligent electricity meter.
				An algorithm detects their wellbeing and sends a daily report to their family members.

					<h3>The challenge</h3>
					<p>
					 Take existing hardware and consumption data and ideate a new product based
					 on a general idea — making seniors independant and safe.
				 	</p>
				</section>
				<h3>My process</h3>
				<p>
				Along with ideating the product from scratch with the product and bussiness team,
				I was also in charge of the UX and UI for the mobile apps.

				<h2>
					During ideation and research phase, we concluded that the most critical
					time is the morning — if something is wrong, it will be visible in the morning electricity consumption.
					Algorithm detects if there was an activity during the morning —
					and the user can set the exact time in which he wants the algorithm to run.
				</h2>

				If there is no activity, the user immediately gets notified via SMS.

				<h3>Personas and user journeys</h3>
				<p>
				To define how the product should function, we used personas and user journey maps
				— good and bad scenarios. This helped us pinpoint morning as the most important time.
				Good + bad user journey explanation.

				<h3>Keeping family members in the loop</h3>
				<p>
				Live consumption graph lets users immediately notice anomalies.
				Activity report provides them with a global insight into the current day.

					The most important part of Fresh Care is outside the app.
			SMS alerts are sent out automatically within 5 minutes of detecting no activity. They also get sent out if there was an error — whether with the internet, algorithm, or ata inconsistency.
			Knowing there was an error, user can check the graph for more details and take necessary actions.
