				<h2>Empowering senior family members with intelligent electricity meters.</h2>
				<p>
				Fresh Care analyzes seniors' electricity usage via an intelligent electricity meter.
				An algorithm detects their wellbeing and sends a daily report to their family members.

					<h3>The challenge</h3>
					<p>
					 Take existing hardware and consumption data and ideate a new product based
					 on a general idea — making seniors independant and safe.
				 	</p>
				</section>
				<h3>My process</h3>
				<p>
				First, I facilitated workshops with the data science team to identify data and hardware limitations.
				Following that, user journeys based on our personas were used to define this
				innovative product within tight constraints.

				<h2>
					During ideation and research phase, we concluded that the most critical
					time in the day of a senior is the morning — if something is wrong,
					electricity consumption won't be average.
					Algorithm detects if there are anomalies in consumption during the morning —
					the end user  (family member) can set the exact time in which the algorithm will run.
				</h2>
			<h2>
				Compared to competitors, Fresh Care requires no cameras or additional hardware —
				making seniors feel independant and empowered.
				If there is a problem, family members immediately get notified via SMS.

				<h3>Personas and user journeys</h3>
				<p>
				To define the product, we used personas and user journey maps
				— good and bad scenarios. This helped us pinpoint morning as the most important time.

					Personas

				<h3>Keeping family members in the loop</h3>
				<p>
				Live consumption graph lets users immediately notice anomalies.
				Activity report provides them with a global insight into the current day.

					The most important part is outside the app —	SMS alerts are sent out automatically within
					5 minutes of detecting no activity. They also get sent out if t here was an error — whether with the internet,
					algorithm, or ata inconsistency.Knowing there was an error, user can check the graph for more details and take necessary actions.

					Morning period are strictly defined for each case
