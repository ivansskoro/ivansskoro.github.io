				<h2>Empowering senior family members with design and intelligent electricity meters.</h2>
				<p>
				Fresh Care analyzes seniors' electricity usage via an intelligent electricity meter.
				An algorithm detects their wellbeing and sends a daily report to their family members.

					<h3>The challenge</h3>
					<p>
					 Take existing hardware and consumption data and ideate a new product based
					 on a general idea — making seniors independant and safe.
				 	</p>
				</section>
				<h3>My process</h3>
				<p>
				First, I facilitated workshops with the data science team to identify data and hardware limitations.
				Following that, user journeys based on our personas were used to define this
				innovative product within tight constraints.

				<h2>
					During ideation and research, we identified the morning as the most critical
					time in the day of a senior.
					Algorithm detects if there are anomalies in electric consumption during the morning.
				</h2>
			<h2>
				Unlike its competitors, Fresh Care requires no cameras or additional hardware —
				making seniors feel independant and empowered.
				Family members are notified via SMS about potential problems.

				<h3>Personas and user journeys</h3>
				<p>
				To define the product, we used personas and user journey maps
				— good and bad scenarios — this helped us pinpoint the morning as the most important time.
				</p>
				</br>
				<p>
					Personas were based on family members of our pilot customers.

					User journey 1 — senior is all right.

				<p>
					User journey 2 — something happens to the senior.

				<h3>Onboarding new users</h3>
				<p>
				Graph and the algorithm behind it are explained to the user during onboarding.
				</p>

				<p>
				Since everyone wakes up at a different time, the end user s (family members)
				can set the exact time in which they want the algorithm to run — corresponding to their senior relative wake up time.

				<h3>Keeping family members in the loop</h3>
				<p>
				Live consumption graph lets users immediately notice anomalies.
				Activity report provides them with a global insight into the current day.
				</p>

				<p>
					The most important part is outside the app —	SMS alerts are sent out automatically within
					5 minutes of detecting no activity. They also get sent out if  there are errors — whether with the internet,
					algorithm, or d ata inconsistency. </br>
					Knowing there was an error, user can check the graph for more details and take necessary actions.
