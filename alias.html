				Players have to describe a given word using its synonyms, without using the root word.
				Alias is available in 5 languages and has been installed over 300.000 times.
				Currently, there are over 80.000 active players.

					<h3>The challenge</h3>
					<p>
					Translating the fun spirit of the game to a mobile app.
					Most users already knew the rules but had 2 main concerns — whose turn it is to
					explain the words, and how much game time remains.
				 	</p>
				</section>
				<h3>My process</h3>
				<p>
					Research into similar apps guided the direction of the design.
					Detailed analysis and playing the game helped me identify the main pain point
					— the time from opening the app to playing a game.

				<h2>
					I branded the app with vivid colors, patterns, and playful animations representing the fun
					spirit of the game. The most common game — consisting of 2 teams — can be started in two taps.
					A timer clearly shows the remaining time and instructions at the beginning of every round inform
					the users about player order.
				</h2>
				<h2>
					I also focused on timely
					informing the players about the next steps in the game.

				<h3>Inviting design</h3>
				<p>
					Homescreen is playful with background animation, inviting users to start a new game.
					Secondary options are presented on the bottom.

					A major complaint from power-players (over 30h of gameplay) was a lack of new words —
					when 3500 words are not enough, users can add their own.

				<h3>Play a game</h3>
				<p>
					Setting up a new game can be done in as little as two taps.
					Two teams are prefilled by default since that is the most common game type.
				</p>
				<img src="asseti/Projekti/Alias/alias_setup.jpg" alt="Alias home">
				<p>
					Teams are deleted through an engaging interaction — accompanied with fun animations.
				</p>
				<img src="asseti/Projekti/Alias/alias_remove.jpg" alt="Alias home">

				<p>
					In the second step, users can set up their game according to their preferences.
				</p>

					Values jump while editing so they don't get obstructed by fingers.

				<h3>Real fun</h3>
				<p>
					A timer is displayed numerically and graphically — a horizontal bar decreases in height as time goes by.
					The active/next player is shown at the bottom. The play screen is color-coded to help players immediately realize whose turn it is.
				</p>
				<img src="asseti/Projekti/Alias/alias_game.jpg" alt="Alias home">

				<p>
					Sometimes, players mark their answers incorrectly and there are discussions whether the guess was fair.
					For that reason, I added answer-editing functionality. Players can edit their answers after
					their round ends.
