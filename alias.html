					<h3>The challenge</h3>
					<p>
					Translating the fun spirit of the game to a mobile app.
					Most users already knew the rules but had 2 main concerns — whose turn it is to
					explain the words, and how much game time remains.
				 	</p>
				</section>
				<h3>My process</h3>
				<p>
					Research into similar apps guided the direction of the design.
					Detailed analysis and playing the game helped me identify the main pain point
					— the time from opening the app to playing a game.

				<h2>
					I branded the app with vivid colors, patterns, and playfull animations representing the fun
					spirit of the game. The most common use case — a game with 2 teams — can be started in two taps.
					A timer clearly shows the remaining time, and instructions before every round inform
					the users about player order.

				<h3>Inviting design</h3>
				<p>
					Homescreen is playful with background animation, inviting users to start a new game.
					Secondary options are presented on the bottom.

				<h3>Play a game</h3>

				<p>
					Setting up a new game can be done in as little as two taps.
					Two teams are prefilled by default since that is the most common team count.
				</p>

				<p>
					Teams are deleted through engaging interaction — acompanied with fun animations.

				<h3>Real fun</h3>
				<p>
					A timer is displayed numerically and graphically — a horizontal bar decreases in height as time goes by.
					Clear indicator on active player is presented on the bottom.
