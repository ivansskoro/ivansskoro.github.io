				<h2>Breaking information asymmetry in the Forex market.</h2>
				<p>
				Mokita or "the truth we all know but agree not to talk about" is a financial tool predicting
				the best time for currency conversion.
				By analyzing vast amount of data, Mokita exploits information asymmetry to
				level out the playing field between providers and end-users.

					<h3>The challenge</h3>
					<p>
						Instill trust in Mokita users — which is always challenging in a financial context.
						Communicate clearly should the user transfer their funds now —
						and which transfer provider they should use.
				 	</p>
				</section>
				<h3>My process</h3>
				<p>
				Initially, detailed interviews with stakeholders were carried out to understand
				their competition, vision, and goals for the product and the brand — near and long term.
				The MVP was designed and tested via inVision — with revisions after user testing.

				<h2>
					Mokita predicts a good transfer window based on macro FX trends.
					Users can easily find out if now is a good time to transfer their money — or get notified
					on time. The best FX providers are easily searchable for each currency pair.

				<h3>Communicating clearly</h3>
				<p>
					Mokita analyzes past FX rates from a multitude of providers and gives a simple YES/NO
					feedback regarding the current rate.

					Users can save their favourite currency pairs for quick access — a
					nd get reminded when the rates are cheap.
				</p>

				<p>
					Transfer providers are listed with cost and transfer-time easily visible.
					This helps users decide on the best transfer provider for their currency pair.

				<h3>Brand design</h3>
				<p>
					A detailed questionnaire was used to recognize how the clients saw the Mokita brand.
					This included questions such as "If Mokita was a car brand,
					which one it would be?", and "Is Mokita accessible or exclusive?".
				</p>
				<img src="asseti/Projekti/Aircash/aircash_placeholder.png" alt="Aircash app homescreen and settings">
				<p>
					Blue color was used to instill trust,
					and an arrow was used as a building element — communicating direct and fast transfers.
				</p>

				<p>
					I designed detailed brand guidelines as well.
