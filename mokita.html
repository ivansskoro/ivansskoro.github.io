				<h2>Breaking information asymmetry in the Forex market</h2>
				<p>
				Mokita or "truth that everybody knows but agrees to not talk about" —
				provides a comprehensive financial tool for expats who
				have commitment or retirement ambitions back home.
				Mokita exploits information asymmetry as an opportunity to
				level out the playing field between providers and end-users.

					<h3>The challenge</h3>
					<p>
						Instill trust in Mokita users — which is always challenging in a financial context.
						Communicate cleary should the user transfer their funds now —
						and which transfer-service they should use.
				 	</p>
				</section>
				<h3>My process</h3>
				<p>
				Initially, detailed interviews with stakeholders were carried out to understand
				their competition, vision, and goals for the product and the brand — near and long term.
				The MVP was designed and tested via inVision — with a round of revisions based on user testing.

				<h3>Brand design</h3>
				<p>
					A detailed questionnaire was used to recognize how the clients saw the Mokita brand.
					This included questions such as "If Mokita was a car brand,
					which one it would be?", and "Is Mokita accessible or exclusive?".
				</p>

				<p>
					Blue color was used to instill trust,
					and an arrow was used as a building element — communicating direct and fast transfers.
