				<p>
				With over 50.000 users and €13mil/year
				in transactions, tight integration with Croatian service providers, and an EU e-money licence — Aircash is one of the biggest players
				on the Croatian fintech scene.

					<p class="naslov">The challenge</p>
					<p>
					Completely rework the app with a new visual language, tackle the (non)existing information architecture, identify user needs, and define and help fulfill business objectives.
				 	</p>
				</section>
				<p class="naslov">My process</p>
				<p>
				Working through analytics data with stakeholders I identified the user goals and business objectives. Redesign and feature roadmaps
				were then prepared in collaboration with product, development and CEO.

				<p class="naslovmega">The lack of visual consistency and information architecture was tackled first.
				After that, I worked on existing and new features directly impacting revenue, user-base growth, and user retention.
				</p>

			<section class="blok">
				<p class="naslov">Information Architecture</p>
				<p>
					The idea was to make the most used features (as seen from analytics) easily accessible,
					while having in mind the business objectives. User goals were defined based on these two inputs,
					complimented with interviews and real-life observation.
				<p>
					The most used features were extracted to the homescreen which accomplished a couple of things. It incentivized use,
					thus increasing revenue, and it placed most often
				</p>
				<p>
					To get the users to their favourite features as fast as possible, biometric login was added, completely removing pain points from opening the app.
				</p>
				<p>
					To reduce development costs and improve usability — hamburger type navigation was kept from the previous — with the "open" button was moved to the bottom.
				</p>
					An unique payment code was moved  to the homescreen to incentivize user-to-user transactions, increasing revenue.
				</p>

			<section class="blok">
				<p class="naslov">Services — Parking / Loyalty</p>
				<p>
						To attract new users and keep the existing ones, I expanded on the "digital wallet" idea. With features such as parking payment,
						loyalty card scanning, and utility bills payment, financial needs of our users were accessed through a single point of contact.
					</p>
						<p>
						With Aircash Pay, users can quickly and easily pay invoices, utility bills or send money to other Aircash users — by scanning a QR code.
					</p>
					<p>
						Along with that we added paying for parking inside Croatian cities — making Aircash attractive to  numerous tourists.

				<p class="naslov">Referall — increasing user base</p>
				<p>
					Users can invite their friends with one tap — sending an SMS with the link.
					Main challenges laid in  showing multiple statuses of invited contacts and explaining the process to the user.
					3 invited users have to top-up their account to complete the referral.
					The referall rate was around 5%, double the industry standard (2.34%)

				<p class="naslov">Aircash Pay / Aircash code / send money / top-up withdraw</p>
				<p>Users can instantly send money abroad and pay for a multitude of services, including parking, topping up prepaid numbers,
					and more.</p>
				<p>Through partnership with PBZ (Intesa Sanpaolo), Aircash users can  use ATMs for money withdrawal — without a bank account. </p>
				<p>
				Withdrawal is done by entering a code generated in the app — faster than using a regular card.

				<p>Even without an account, new users can open and explore the app, incentivizing account creation.</p>
				<p>Revised onboarding simplified the process of creating an account</p>
				<p>Adding biometric login removed the biggest painpoint in opening the app — entering your PIN</p>
