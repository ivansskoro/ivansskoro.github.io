				<h2>Product design for a new type of financial institution on the market —
					a digital wallet requiring no bank account.</h2>
				<p>
				With over 100.000 users and €13mil/year
				in transactions, tight integration with Croatian service providers, and an EU
				e-money licence — Aircash is one of the biggest players
				on the Croatian fintech scene.

					<h3>The challenge</h3>
					<p>
					Completely rework the app with a new visual language,
					tackle the (non)existing information architecture, identify user needs,
					and define and help fulfill business goals.
				 	</p>
				</section>
				<h3>My process</h3>
				<p>
				Working through analytics data with stakeholders I identified the user goals
				and business objectives. I then prepared and executed redesign and feature roadmaps
				in collaboration with product, development, and CEO.
				</p>

				<h2>First, I tackled the lack of visual consistency and information architecture.
					After that, I worked on existing and new features impacting revenue,
					user base growth, and user retention.
				</h2>
				<h2>
					As a result, the user base grew by +1000%, with weekly user events growing by +360%.
				</h2>

				<h3>Information Architecture</h3>
				<p>
					The idea was to make the most used features accessible
					while having in mind the business goals. Analytics and business objectives defined,
					complemented with interviews and real-life observation, defined user goals.
					I designed detailed user flows for every section.

				<p>
					Send, top-up, and withdraw were extracted to the home screen.
					Now, all money operations are accessible immediately after opening the app.
				</p>
				<p>
					To increase revenue, marketplace was shown on the home screen, incentivizing use.

					Adding biometric login removed pain points in the initial phase of each user journey.

				<p>
					Side-menu type navigation was kept in the redesign to reduce development costs,
					but the "open" button was moved to the bottom, improving usability.
				</p>

				<p>
					A unique Aircash-code was added to the homescreen —
					incentivizing user-to-user transactions and increasing revenue.
					App and user settings were moved to the profile section, accessible from the homescreen.

				<h3>New services</h3>
				<p>
				To attract new and keep existing users, I expanded on the "digital wallet" idea.
				Features such as utility bills payment, parking payment, and loyalty card scanning
				consolidated the financial needs of our users at a single point.</p>
					<p>
					With Aircash Pay users can quickly pay invoices, utility bills or send money to other Aircash
					users — by scanning a QR code.
				</p>
				<img src="asseti/Projekti/Aircash/aircash_placeholder.png" alt="Aircash app homescreen and settings">
				<p>
					Adding Parking payment simplified our users' lives — instead of using city-specific
					apps or paying with cash, they can pay with their Aircash wallet.
				</p>
				<img src="asseti/Projekti/Aircash/aircash_placeholder.png" alt="Aircash app homescreen and settings">
				<p>
					Various versions showing the progress of the feature — design was reworked after early testing.

				<h3>Increasing userbase through referalls</h3>
				<p>
					Users can invite their friends with one tap — sending an SMS with the link. The referral rate was over 7%.
				</p>

				<img src="asseti/Projekti/Aircash/aircash_placeholder.png" alt="Aircash app homescreen and settings">

				</br>
				<p>
					The main challenges were showing the statuses of invited contacts and explaining the referral
					process to the user. Three invited users have to top-up their accounts to complete the referral.

				<h3>Transactions</h3>
				<p>
					Users can instantly send money anywhere in the world, together with a nice message.
				</p>
				<img src="asseti/Projekti/Aircash/aircash_placeholder.png" alt="Aircash app homescreen and settings">

				<p>
					Users can top-up with either a card or with cash — for free — at more than 1000 locations in Croatia.
					This is a feature most competitors don't have — they limit their users with top-up fees or
					a small location number.
				</p>
				<img src="asseti/Projekti/Aircash/aircash_placeholder.png" alt="Aircash app homescreen and settings">

				<p>
					Through partnership with an Intesa Sanpaolo group bank, PBZ, Aircash users can  use
					ATMs for money withdrawal — without a bank account.
					Withdrawal is done by entering a code generated in the app — faster than using a regular card.
				</p>
				<img src="asseti/Projekti/Aircash/aircash_placeholder.png" alt="Aircash app homescreen and settings">
				<p>
					Money can also be withdrawn at the aforementioned thousands of locations.
					A barcode is generated and shown to the employee.

				<h3>Welcoming new users</h3>

				<p>Even without an account, new users can open and explore the app, incentivizing account creation.</p>
				<img src="asseti/Projekti/Aircash/aircash_placeholder.png" alt="Aircash app homescreen and settings">

				<p>Revised onboarding simplified and sped up the process of opening an account.
					A clear progress indicator is shown throughout the whole process.</p>

					Visual language was unified accross both platfrom, while adhering to platform
					specific design guidelines.

				<p>Simple and playful were the directions for iconography —
					diverging from main competitors, banking applications.</p>

				<p>
					Default platform fonts were used together with a simple color palette in an effort
