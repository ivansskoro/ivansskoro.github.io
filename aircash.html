				<h2>Product design for a new kind of financial institution on the market — a digital wallet requiring no bank account.</h2>
				<p>
				With over 100.000 users and €13mil/year
				in transactions, tight integration with Croatian service providers, and an EU e-money licence — Aircash is one of the biggest players
				on the Croatian fintech scene.

					<h3>The challenge</h3>
					<p>
					Completely rework the app with a new visual language, tackle the (non)existing information architecture, identify user needs,
					and define and help fulfill business objectives.
				 	</p>
				</section>
				<h3>My process</h3>
				<p>
				Working through analytics data with stakeholders I identified the user goals and business objectives. Redesign and feature roadmaps
				were then prepared in collaboration with product, development and CEO.
				</p>

				<h2>The lack of visual consistency and information architecture was tackled first.
				After that, I worked on existing and new features directly impacting revenue, user-base growth, and user retention.
				</h2>
			<h2>
				As a result, the userbase grew by +1000%, with weekly user events growing by +360%.
			</h2>
			</br>

				<h3>Information Architecture</h3>
				<p>
					The idea was to make the most used features (as identified from analytics) easily accessible,
					while having in mind the business objectives. User goals were defined based on these two inputs,
					complimented with interviews and real-life observation.
				</p>
				</br>
				<p>
					Sections and features were grouped logically based on user and business goals.
				</p>
				<img src="asseti/Projekti/Aircash/aircash_placeholder.png" alt="Aircash app homescreen and settings">

				<p>
					Send, top-up/withdraw and marketplace were extracted to the homescreen. This meant that all money operation were accessible
					immediately after opening the app. By showing the marketplace on the homescreen, use was incentivized, increasing revenue.
				</p>
				<img src="asseti/Projekti/Aircash/aircash_placeholder.png" alt="Aircash app homescreen and settings">

				<p>
					Biometric login was added, removing data-entering pain points in the initial phase of user journeys.
				</p>

				<img src="asseti/Projekti/Aircash/aircash_placeholder.png" alt="Aircash app homescreen and settings">

				<p>
					To reduce development costs, side-menu type navigation was kept from the previous version, but the "open"
					button was moved to the bottom, improving usability.
				</p>
				<img src="asseti/Projekti/Aircash/aircash_placeholder.png" alt="Aircash app homescreen and settings">

				<p>
					A unique Aircash-code was added to the homescreen —
					incentivizing user-to-user transactions and increasing revenue.

				<h3>New services</h3>
				<p>
					To attract new and keep existing users, I expanded on the "digital wallet" idea. With features such as utility bills payment, parking payment,
					and loyalty card scanning, financial needs of our users were consolidated in a single point.
				</p>

				</br>
					<p>
					With Aircash Pay users can quickly pay invoices, utility bills or send money to other Aircash users — by scanning a QR code.
				</p>
				<img src="asseti/Projekti/Aircash/aircash_placeholder.png" alt="Aircash app homescreen and settings">
				<p>
					Parking payment was added as another way of empowering our users — instead of using city specific apps or paying with cash,
					they can pay directly from their Aircash wallet.
				</p>
				<img src="asseti/Projekti/Aircash/aircash_placeholder.png" alt="Aircash app homescreen and settings">
				<p>
					Various versions showing the progress of the feature — reworked after early testing.

				<h3>Increasing userbase through referalls</h3>
				<p>
					Users can invite their friends with one tap — sending an SMS with the link.
					</p>

					<img src="asseti/Projekti/Aircash/aircash_placeholder.png" alt="Aircash app homescreen and settings">
					<h2>
					The referall rate was over 7%.
				</h2>
				</br>
				<p>
					Main challenges laid in  showing multiple statuses of invited contacts and explaining the process to the user.
					3 invited users have to top-up their account to complete the referral.

				<h3>Transactions</h3>
				<p>Users can instantly send money and top-up their balance at more than 1000 locations in Croatia — or by using their card.</p>
				<img src="asseti/Projekti/Aircash/aircash_placeholder.png" alt="Aircash app homescreen and settings">

				<p>Through partnership with an Intesa Sanpaolo group bank, PBZ, Aircash users can  use ATMs for money withdrawal — without a bank account.
				Withdrawal is done by entering a code generated in the app — faster than using a regular card.
