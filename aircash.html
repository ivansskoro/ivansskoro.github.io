				<p>
				Aircash is a digital wallet offering easy top-up and money withdrawal — while not requiring users to be a bank account holder — a new type of financial institution on the market.</p>
				<p>Users can instantly send money abroad and pay for  a multitude of services, including parking, topping up prepaid numbers,  and more.</p> 
				<p>Through partnership with PBZ (Intesa Sanpaolo), Aircash users can  use ATMs for money withdrawal — without a bank account. </p>
				</br>

				<p>
				Croatian National Bank has granted Aircash a full EU license for electronic money. 
				<p>
				With over 50.000 users and €13m/year in transaction amount — coupled with tight integration with many Croatian service providers — Aircash is one of the main players on the Croatian fintech scene.

				<p class="naslov">Brief</p>
				<p>
				The existing versions of the app was in need of a refresh. Architecture was based on Cordova and design was an afterthought, taken care of by the development team. </p>
				<p>Information architecture was non-existent — there  was no clear hierarchy guiding the user through  the experience. 
				</p>
				</br>
				<p class="naslov">My contribution</p>
				<p>
				Working through analytics together with stakeholders we defined the most used features of the app and decided on a roadmap  for redesign. 
				The lack of visual consistency and  information architecture was tackled first. </p>
				<p>Following that, I worked on defining, designing, and expanding the services section — our main source of revenue and customer growth.
				</p>
				<p>We also payed special attention to the user experience, designing and rolling out completely new onboarding and login sections in the app.</p>
