				<p class="naslov">Aircash is a new kind of financial institution on the market —  a digital wallet offering easy top-up and
					money withdrawal — all without a bank account.</p>


				<p>
				Owner of EU electronic money license, and with over 50.000 users and €13mil/year
				in transactions — coupled with tight integration with many Croatian service providers — Aircash is one of the main players
				on the Croatian fintech scene.
				</p>

				<!-- <p>/Users can instantly send money abroad and pay for a multitude of services, including parking, topping up prepaid numbers,
					and more.</p>
				<p>/Through partnership with PBZ (Intesa Sanpaolo), Aircash users can use ATMs for money withdrawal — without a bank account. </p> -->

				<p class="naslov">Brief</p>
				<p>
				The existing version of the app was in need of a complete rework. Architecture was based on Cordova and design was an afterthought,
				taken care of by the development team. </p>
				<p>Information architecture was non-existent — there was no clear hierarchy guiding the user through the experience.
				</p>
				</br>
				<p class="naslov">Process overview</p>
				<p>
				Working through analytics data with stakeholders, I identified the most used features of the app and decided on a
				roadmap  for redesign.
				The lack of visual consistency and information architecture was tackled first. </p>
				<p>
					Following that, I worked on defining, designing, and expanding the services section — our main source of revenue and
					customer growth.
				</p>
				<p>Special attention was given to the new user experience by designing new onboarding and
					login sections.</p>
