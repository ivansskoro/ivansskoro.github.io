				<h2>Design your interior and decrease illegally high rents — with Augmented Reality.</h2>
				<p>
					Based in Berlin, Roometric provides mobile measurement solutions.
					Their apps generate fully 3D interior scans with only a smartphone.
					Scans an be imported into interior planing solutions or used to calculate
					if the rent is illegally high.

					<h3>The challenge</h3>
					<p>
					The AR scanning process had too many steps and it was long and complicated.
					There was no clear flow and major inconsistencies in the information architecture
					presented problems for the users — identical elements behaved differently on different screens,
					and back/cancel hierarchy was not consistent.
				 	</p>
				</section>
				<h3>My process</h3>
				<p>
					Observing users while they used the app and getting informed about the technical
					limitations of the software helped me define a new user flow.
					Each revision of the main feature — the scaning process — was tested with 3 users. The rest of
					the app was structured and designed following regular UI & UX practices.
					I complimented the new design with a public website.

				<h2>
					A step-by-step wizard was implemented as a solution to a complicated scan
					Information structure was revisited. Adding success messages and improving guides and
					tips solved some of the problems. Providing users with consistent back functionality
					and warnings for destructive actions solved the rest.
				</h2>
			<h2>
				Number of steps in the main flow was decreased, and scaning a room was around -15% faster.

				<h3>Flow diagram</h3>
				<p>
					Based on user observations a new flow diagram was designed 
					for future reference.	Step-by-step scan instructions guide the user through the most
					complicated flow in the app.

					A detailed flow diagram helped me to identify the main issues in the flow
					and streamline the scanning process.

				<h3>AR scanning</h3>
				<p>
					Users can see all of their measured appartments and easily create a new measurement.
				</p>
				<img src="asseti/Projekti/Aircash/aircash_placeholder.png" alt="Aircash app homescreen and settings">
				<p>
					Most of our users are not familiar with AR, so it
					is important to guide them and provide them with constructive feedback.
				</p>
				<img src="asseti/Projekti/Aircash/aircash_placeholder.png" alt="Aircash app homescreen and settings">

				<p>
					All measurements taken by users are displayed in real time AR, providing users with feedback.

				<h3>After the scan</h3>
				<p>
					The final step is sending the 3D-plan to the interior planner.
					To do this, the user scans a QR code inside 3rd party desktop software for interior planing.
					The app injects the URL with correct parameters making the room available in the desktop app.
					After that, he can easily share the link with his interior designer.
				</p>

					User is informed about potential savings.

				<p>
					Scan with all measurements and
					elements (doors, windows etc.) can be uploaded to 3rd party services.

				<h3>Design system</h3>
				<p>
					A minimal amount of colors and elements puts the focus on the AR experience.

				<h3>Public website</h3>
				<p>
					The new visual language was applied to a simple landing page —
					communicating the feature set and advantages of Roometric
