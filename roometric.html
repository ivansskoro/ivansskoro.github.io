				<h2>Measuring apartments in AR.</h2>
				<p>
					Based in Berlin, Roometric provides mobile measurement solutions.
					Their apps generate fully 3D interior scans with only a smartphone.
					Scans an be imported into interior planing solutions or used to calculate
					if the rent is illegally high.

					<h3>The challenge</h3>
					<p>
					The scanning process was done in AR, and it was long and complicated.
					There was no clear flow, and major inconsistencies in the information architecture
					presented problems for the users — identical functions behaved differently on different screens,
					and back/cancel hierarchy was not consistent.
				 	</p>
				</section>
				<h3>My process</h3>
				<p>
					Observing users while they used the app and getting informed about the technical
					limitations of the software helped me design a new user flow.
					Each revision of the main feature — the scaning process — was tested with 3 users. The rest of
					the app was structured and designed following regular UI & UX practices.

				Solutions
				</p>
				<h2>
					A step-by-step wizard was implemented as a solution to a complicated scan
					Information structure was revisited. Adding success messages and improving guides and
					tips solved some of the problems. Providing users with consistent back functionality
					and warnings for destructive actions solved the rest.
				</h2>
			<h2>
				Number of steps in the main flow was decreased, and scaning a room was around -15% faster.

				<h3>Information Architecture</h3>
				<p>
					Tab bar navigation replaced the old side-menu navigation.
					Based on user interviews, new sections — profile and household information —
					were added to their expected places.
					To support future business goals, a services section was added as well.

					A live meter readout was added as well — our users can check
					their meter status without a trip to the basement.
