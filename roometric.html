				<h2>Designing in Augmented Reality to decrease illegally high rents and plan interiors.</h2>
				<p>
				Based in Berlin, Roometric provides mobile measurement solutions.
				Their apps generate 3D interior scans with only a smartphone.
				Scans an be imported into interior planing solutions or used to calculate
				if the rent is illegally high.

					<h3>The challenge</h3>
					<p>
					Redesign a complicated Augmented Reality scanning process.
					There was no clear flow and major inconsistencies in the information architecture
					presented problems for the users — identical elements behaved differently on different screens,
					and back/cancel hierarchy was not consistent.
				 	</p>
				</section>
				<h3>My process</h3>
				<p>
					Observing users while they used the app and getting informed about the technical
					limitations of the software helped me define a new user flow.
					Each revision of the main feature — the scaning process — was tested with 3 users. The rest of
					the app was structured and designed following regular UI & UX practices.
					I complimented the new design with a public website.

				<h2>
					A step-by-step wizard was implemented to simplify the scaning process.
					Information structure was revised with success messages and improved with guides and
					scaning tips. Users were provided with consistent back functionality
					and warnings for destructive actions.
				</h2>
				<h2>
					Number of steps in the main flow was decreased, speeding up the scaning process.

				<h3>Flow diagram</h3>
				<p>
					Based on user observations and stakeholder intreviews a new flow diagram was designed 
					for future reference.	Step-by-step scan instructions guide the user through the most
					complicated flow in the app.

					A detailed flow diagram helped me to identify the main issues and streamline the scanning process.
					Users were provided with consistent back functionality
					and warnings for destructive actions — all missing in the previous version.

				<h3>AR scanning</h3>
				<p>
					Users can see all of their measured appartments and easily create a new measurement.
				</p>
				<img src="asseti/Projekti/Aircash/aircash_placeholder.png" alt="Aircash app homescreen and settings">
				<p>
					Most of the users were not familiar  with AR, so it
					is important to provide them with constructive and timely feedback.
				</p>

				<p>
					All measurements taken by users are displayed in real time AR, providing users with feedback.

				<h3>After the scan</h3>

				<p>
					User is presented with a full 3D model — with floor and wall area surface calculated automatically.
				</p>
				<img src="asseti/Projekti/Aircash/aircash_placeholder.png" alt="Aircash app homescreen and settings">
				<p>
					Possible rent decrease and payback are shown if the user pays too much rent.
					The app compares the rent to the law defined limit for that area and housing size.
				</p>
				<img src="asseti/Projekti/Aircash/aircash_placeholder.png" alt="Aircash app homescreen and settings">

				<p>
					Scan with all measurements and elements (doors, windows etc.) can be uploaded to 3rd party services.
					Users can export a file or generate a QR code.
					QR code is scanned via 3rd party desktop software.
					The app injects the URL with correct parameters making the scan available
					in desktop interior planing software.
					After that, users can easily share their plan interior designers.

				<h3>Design system</h3>
				<p>
					A minimal amount of colors and elements puts the focus on the AR experience.
					Since the app was developed in Unity, Inter typeface — carefully crafted & designed
					for screens — was used accross both platform.

				<h3>Public website</h3>
				<p>
					The new visual language was applied to a simple landing page as well—
					communicating the features and advantages of Roometric to private and business customers.
