				<h2>Designing in Augmented Reality to decrease illegally high rents and plan interiors.</h2>
				<p>
					Based in Berlin, Roometric provides mobile measurement solutions.
					Their apps generate 3D interior scans with only a smartphone.
					Scans an be imported into interior planing solutions or used to calculate
					if the rent is illegally high.

					<h3>The challenge</h3>
					<p>
					Redesign a complicated AR scanning process with too many steps.
					There was no clear flow and major inconsistencies in the information architecture
					presented problems for the users — identical elements behaved differently on different screens,
					and back/cancel hierarchy was not consistent.
				 	</p>
				</section>
				<h3>My process</h3>
				<p>
					Observing users while they used the app and getting informed about the technical
					limitations of the software helped me define a new user flow.
					Each revision of the main feature — the scaning process — was tested with 3 users. The rest of
					the app was structured and designed following regular UI & UX practices.
					I complimented the new design with a public website.

				<h2>
					A step-by-step wizard was implemented to simplify the scaning process.
					Information structure was revised with success messages and improved with guides and
					scaning tips. Users were provided with consistent back functionality
					and warnings for destructive actions.
				</h2>
			<h2>
				Number of steps in the main flow was decreased, speeding up the scaning process.

				<h3>Flow diagram</h3>
				<p>
					Based on user observations a new flow diagram was designed 
					for future reference.	Step-by-step scan instructions guide the user through the most
					complicated flow in the app.

					A detailed flow diagram helped me to identify the main issues in the flow
					and streamline the scanning process. Users were provided with consistent back functionality
					and warnings for destructive actions — all missing in the previous version.

				<h3>AR scanning</h3>
				<p>
					Users can see all of their measured appartments and easily create a new measurement.
				</p>
				<img src="asseti/Projekti/Aircash/aircash_placeholder.png" alt="Aircash app homescreen and settings">
				<p>
					Most of our users are not familiar with AR, so it
					is important to guide them and provide them with constructive feedback.
				</p>
				<img src="asseti/Projekti/Aircash/aircash_placeholder.png" alt="Aircash app homescreen and settings">

				<p>
					All measurements taken by users are displayed in real time AR, providing users with feedback.

				<h3>After the scan</h3>

				<p>
					User gets a full 3D model with floor and wall area surface calculated for him.
				</p>
				<img src="asseti/Projekti/Aircash/aircash_placeholder.png" alt="Aircash app homescreen and settings">
				<p>
					Potential rent savings are communicated to the user.
					The app compares the rent to the law defined limit for that area and housing size.
				</p>
				<img src="asseti/Projekti/Aircash/aircash_placeholder.png" alt="Aircash app homescreen and settings">

				<p>
					Scan with all measurements and
					elements (doors, windows etc.) can be uploaded to 3rd party services. Users can export a file or
					scans a QR code inside 3rd party desktop software for interior planing.
					The app injects the URL with correct parameters making the scan available on desktop.
					After that, he can easily share the link with his interior designer.

				<h3>Design system</h3>
				<p>
					A minimal amount of colors and elements puts the focus on the AR experience.

				<h3>Public website</h3>
				<p>
					The new visual language was applied to a simple landing page —
					communicating the feature set and advantages of Roometric
