				<h2>Designing in Augmented Reality to decrease illegally high rents and plan interiors.</h2>
				<p>
				Based in Berlin, Roometric provides mobile measurement solutions.
				Their apps generate 3D interior scans with only a smartphone.
				Scans an be imported into interior planing solutions or used to calculate
				if the rent is illegally high.

					<h3>The challenge</h3>
					<p>
					Redesign a complicated Augmented Reality interior scanning process.
					There was no clear flow and major inconsistencies in the information architecture
					presented problems for the users — identical elements behaved differently on different screens,
					and back/cancel hierarchy was not consistent.
				 	</p>
				</section>
				<h3>My process</h3>
				<p>
					Observing users while they used the app and getting informed about the technical
					limitations of the software helped me define a new user flow.
					Each revision of the main feature — the scanning process — was tested with 3 users. The rest of
					the app was structured and designed following regular UI & UX practices.
					I complimented the new design with a public website.

				<h2>
					A step-by-step wizard was implemented to simplify the scanning process.
					Information structure was revised with success messages and improved with guides and
					scanning tips. Users were provided with consistent back functionality
					and warnings for destructive actions.
				</h2>
				<h2>
					Number of steps in the main flow was decreased, speeding up the scanning process.

				<h3>Information architecture</h3>
				<p>
					Based on user observations and stakeholder intreviews, a revised information architecture was designed 
					for future reference.	This helped in pinpointing and correcting UX problems.

				<h3>AR scanning</h3>
				<p>
					Users can see their measured appartments or start a new measurement directly from the home screen.
				</p>

				<p class="imageCaption">
					Empty state illustration invites users to start scanning.
				</p>
				<p>
					Most of the users were not familiar  with AR, so it
					is important to provide them with constructive and timely instructions and feedback.
					Each measurement step is categorized based on the objects user will be measuring in that step.
				</p>

				<p>
					Measuring is done by taping the "+" button when it is aligned with a corner of the measured object.
					Measurements are immediately calculated and overlayed in AR, providing reassurance that the scan is going well.

				<h3>After the scan</h3>


				<p>
					Potential rent decrease and payback are shown if the user pays too much rent.
					The app compares the rent to the law defined limit for that area and housing size.

					Appartment details are shown in a contextual menu.
				</p>
				<p>
					User is presented with a full 3D model — with floor and wall area surface calculated automatically.
				</p>
				<img src="asseti/Projekti/Roometric/roometric_after_1.jpg" alt="Roometric user flow">
				<p>
					Users can export a scan with all the measurements and elements or upload it to 3rd party services
					 — easily sharing their appartment plan with interior designers.
				</p>

				<h3>Design system</h3>
				<p>
					A minimal amount of colors and elements puts the focus on the AR experience.
					Since the app was developed in Unity, Inter typeface — carefully crafted & designed
					for screens — was used accross both platform.

				<h3>Public website</h3>
				<p>
					The new visual language was applied to a simple landing page as well—
					communicating the features and advantages of Roometric to private and business customers.
